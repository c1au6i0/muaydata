I am a data analysis enthusiast and fan of the art of the eight limbs (Muay Thai). I was born and I grow up in the eternal city. Now I live in the city of the late Edgar Allan Poe. 

In this blog I will publish analysis of muay-thai and kickboxing fights. Why do I do that? Well, even when I watch fights I cannot avoid to think about numbers!

If you like `R` check [my other blog](https://rden.netlify.com/) that focuses on programming.
This blog was built in `RStudio` using `RMarkdown`, `Rblogdown` and `Hugo`.
