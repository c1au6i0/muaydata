I am a data analysis enthusiast and fan of the art of the eight limbs (Muay Thai). I was born and I grow up in the eternal city. Now I live in the city of the late Edgar Allan Poe. 

This is where I play with data and `R`.

This blog was built in `RStudio` using `RMarkdown`, `Rblogdown` and `Hugo`.
