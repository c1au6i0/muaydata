**Who are the best?** </br>
This June, the lightweight kickboxing ranking by [Combat Press](http://combatpress.com/2019/06/combat-press-kickboxing-rankings-june-2019/) was the following:

1. **Marat Grigorian**
2. **Sitthichai Sitsongpeenong**
3. **Superbon Banchamek**
4. **Giorgio Petrosyan**
5. **Chingiz Allazov**
6. Tayfun Ozcan
7. Endy Semeleer 
8. Jonay Risco 
9. Samy Sana 
10. Yodsanklai Fairtex 

Let's compare the data of the top 5 fighters.

In the charts, fighters will be arranged from left to right by their ranking. 

## Height and Age

The tallest fighter is Allazov (5 ft 11 in), whereas the shortest is Sitthichai (5 ft 8 1/2 in). **The top 2 ranked fighters are also the shortest.**

The top 5 fighters are **between 26 (Allazov) and 34 (Petrosyan) years old**. Grigorian and Sitthichai are both 28 years old (but Grigorian is few months younger).

## Wins and  KOs 

**All of the top 5 kickboxers have phenomenal records, with ~75% (Superbon) to ~95% (Petrosyan and Allazov) of victories**.

**Petrosyan and Allazov are close to perfection** with about 19 victories every 20 fights. Let's suppose that we toss a  coin 4 times and we get every single time head... Would you bet on that? Well, for those 2 fighters, the probability of **not winning a fight** is very close to that (actually a little bit less for Petrosyan)...we can say that is extremely unlikely!

**Who is more likely to end up a fight with a KO win?**

<img src="/post/2019-06-16-kickboxing-lightweight-ranking_files/figure-html/KO_wins-1.png" width="672" />

**The KO machine is Allazov**. He finished **more than half of his fights with his opponent lying on the canvas**. 

**Also Petrosyan and Grigorian have impressive KO power:** about ~45% of their fights ending with a win by KO. 

The 2 Thai fighters, **Sitthichai and Superbon** have the **lowest percent of KOs victories** but on the other hand also the highest number of fights (159 and 143, respectively).

## Winning Streak

Among the 5 top kickboxer, **Petrosyan has the longest winning streak (14) and has not lost or draw a fight since 2013** (against Andy Ristie).  

**Superbon is currently in 8 winning streak**. His last defeat was in a fight against the number 1 Grigorian and came by a tremendous KO stoppage.

**Grigorian, Sitthichai, Allazov, they have all recently lost a fight in bouts against each other or Petrosyan**.
