      <title>ONE World GP quarter-final: time in break</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After an official review, the bout between &lt;strong&gt;Petchmorakot versus Petroysan&lt;/strong&gt; was overturn to a &amp;ldquo;No Contest&amp;rdquo; because &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/yodchatri/posts/2345566252172189&#34;&gt;illegal clinching was not adequately controlled by the referee&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;How much time was wasted&lt;/strong&gt; because the referee had to repeatedly break the fighters during clinch?&lt;/br&gt;
..and &lt;strong&gt;how does that compare with&lt;/strong&gt; the time in break of &lt;strong&gt;the other quarter-final fights?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/br&gt;
We will answer those questions using few charts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ONE World GP: Petchmorakot vs Petrosyan</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Friday, &lt;strong&gt;Petchmorakot Pechindee Academy&lt;/strong&gt; brought home a stunning win against  &lt;strong&gt;Giorgio &amp;ldquo;the Doctor&amp;rdquo; Petrosyan&lt;/strong&gt; and, as often happens with split decisions, the judges score generated a lot of discussion.
The decision was later declared &lt;strong&gt;No Contest&lt;/strong&gt; because of the inadequate control by the referee of excessive clinching. &lt;strong&gt;I carefully looked at the video of the fight, patiently recorded each single strike to come out with few charts of stats&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
